Problem:-

In this problem, we have provided you one project containing some entities and a database dump. You need to use this project and dump to create two API's:-

1) Create an API to import an excel sheet present in the zip. While importing the excel file follow bellow points.

a) Unit Name, status, description will store in the unit table.
b) The type is already present in the unit_type table or not. If not present create a entry in unit_type table and store the id of 	row in the unit table as unit_type.
c) ConversionUid column contains the row number for eg:- 3 that means 3rd row in the excel sheet. So you need to map the id from the database of the current row and ConversionUid column row (i.e 3rd-row id from database) in the unit_conversion_mapping table as conversion_from is the id of the current row and conversion_to is the id of ConversionUid row and value as conversion value from the excel sheet.
*Make sure no duplicate is allowed while storing data in the database.

2) Create an API to get a list of units in the same structure as given in the excel file in which if we provide:-

a) PageNo and Page size so we will get data according to pagination and if no pageNo and page size is provided then all data is visible.
b) Filter Option (optional) which will filter data by unit name or unit type for eg:- if provide distance in a filter then all the units having distance as type will show in the output.
